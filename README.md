# monzocruncher

Convert Monzo business banking CSV exports into a format that the Crunch accounting app will accept, for monthly reconciliation.

Personal hobby project over-engineered in order to play with Elm parsers.

The CSV file is parsed and displayed entirely client-side, no data is uploaded or stored anywhere.
